# Inventory-Management-through-Image-Classification

This project is an end-to-end computer vision system for classifying inventory items with high accuracy. Leveraging TensorFlow and deep learning techniques, the system processes images to automate inventory management tasks.

Highlights
High Accuracy: Built a computer vision system using TensorFlow that achieves 96% accuracy in classifying inventory items.

Model Optimization: Fine-tuned and benchmarked 4 CNN models—including EfficientNet and ResNet—on a dataset of 10,000 images.

Performance Evaluation: Assessed model performance using scikit-learn’s confusion matrix, precision, and recall metrics.
