# Inventory-Management-through-Image-Classification

•	Built a high-accuracy (96%) computer vision system using TensorFlow for classification of inventory items.
•	Fine-tuned and benchmarked 4 CNN models (inc. EfficientNet, ResNet) on a dataset of 10,000 images.
•	Evaluated model performance via confusion matrix, Precision, and Recall metrics using scikit-learn.
